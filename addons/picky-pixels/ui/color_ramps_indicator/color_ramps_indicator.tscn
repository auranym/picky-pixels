This color ramp encodes the behavior of that pixel for each light level. Since this data is stored in a pixel's color value, there are a limited number of possible values that the color could be, so there is a cap on the number of color ramps.

If you are running out of color ramps, try recompiling, or consider using less colors in your palette."
